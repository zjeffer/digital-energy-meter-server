## Archived project 

I switched to using the `DSMR Smart Meter` Home Assistant integration with [smartmeterbridge](https://github.com/legolasbo/smartmeterBridge) instead of using this server. See https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/dsmr for more info.

This project still works though if you want to have a simple Python server that provides you with the data from your digital energy meter.
